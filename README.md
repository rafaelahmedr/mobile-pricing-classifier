# Estimating Mobile Phone Price Ranges using Machine Learning

This project presents a machine learning solution to classify mobile phones into distinct price categoriesâ€”Low, Medium, High, and Very Highâ€”based on their hardware and feature specifications. It simulates a real-world scenario where accurate product positioning is crucial for market competitiveness and customer targeting.

The solution is implemented in R and leverages classification models including Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests, with a focus on model tuning and feature insights.
