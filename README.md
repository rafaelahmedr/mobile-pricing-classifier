# Estimating Mobile Phone Price Ranges using Machine Learning

This project aims to build a machine learning model that classifies mobile phones into price categories based on technical specifications. It is based on a real-world business case study where pricing strategy is crucial for new entrants in the competitive mobile phone market.

---

## Background

Bob is a young entrepreneur who has recently launched his own mobile phone company. Determined to compete with established players like Apple, Samsung, and Xiaomi, he understands that accurate pricing is critical for market entry and consumer appeal.

To make informed pricing decisions, Bob collected a dataset containing detailed specifications of mobile phones from various manufacturers, along with the price range category of each phone. His goal is not to predict the exact price but to classify each phone into one of four price rangesâ€”Low, Medium, High, or Very Highâ€”based on its features.

Lacking the technical skills, Bob has reached out for help to build a machine learning model that accomplishes this classification task.

## Objective

Build a model that predicts the price range (`price_range`) of a mobile phone based on its technical features. The model should also provide insight into which features most influence pricing, helping Bob strategically position his products in the market.

## Dataset Overview

- **Observations**: 2,000 rows
- **Features**: 20 independent variables + 1 target variable
- **Target variable**: `price_range` (0 = Low, 1 = Medium, 2 = High, 3 = Very High)
